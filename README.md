# 🕹️ Spock Rock Game Project 🕹️

Welcome to my Spock Rock game project! This project is a fun twist on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, inspired by the expanded version known as Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard. I started with a template that provided some CSS for appearance, and then I added my own HTML, JavaScript, and a bit more CSS to bring the game to life.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to learn how to build a Spock Rock game using JavaScript, focusing on user interaction and animation.

## ✨ Purpose

This project aimed to achieve the following:

- **Player Selection**: Implemented logic to read the player's selection.
- **Computer Selection**: Created a function to generate a random selection for the computer using `Math.random`.
- **Result Checking**: Developed a function to check the results of each turn, increase scores, and update the scoreboard to determine the winner.
- **Reset Function**: Added functionality to reset all values for a fresh game start.
- **Confetti Animation**: Integrated modules for confetti animation to celebrate wins and learned to refactor modules for better code organization.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Enhanced my understanding of JavaScript by implementing game logic.
- **Random Number Generation**: Gained experience with generating random numbers and using them effectively in game development.
- **Event Handling**: Improved skills in setting up and managing event listeners for player interactions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Strengthened my ability to manipulate the DOM to create a dynamic and interactive game interface.
- **Code Refactoring**: Learned to refactor code into modules for better organization and maintainability.
- **Animation Integration**: Integrated and customized animation modules for an engaging user experience.

Feel free to explore the project and see how the game logic is implemented. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 😊
